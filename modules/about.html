    <p>G'Day Class, my name is Steve!</p>

    <p>I grew up in rural Australia and now I live in Tennessee with my beautiful wife, Rachel. We have been married for about five years and are expecting our first child, a baby boy we will name William, in the next 2-3 weeks! I've had some HTML and CSS experience before and am currently also taking Advanced CSS, which is why I decided to have some fun with this layout.</p>

    <p>Being from the coast, I grew up doing a lot of spear fishing and have my scuba license. Australians are generally very active people and so I grew up also playing a lot of sport! Outside of that, I enjoy playing computer games and spending time with my family.</p>
